Sources have confirmed a rumor claiming that Andrew has had a long time crush on the X-Men character, Jubilee (aka Jubilation Lee).  &#8220;I&#8217;ve never really had Asian fever, but I think Jubilee&#8217;s really hot,&#8221; comments Andrew.  &#8220;I see sparks even when she&#8217;s not using her mutant powers.&#8221;</p>
<p>When asked how this attraction effects his personal life, Andrew answered &#8220;well, one of the main reasons why I&#8217;m dating my current girlfriend is that both of their names start with a J.  Sometimes I pretend that Jen can shoot sparks out of her hands and it&#8217;s really cool.  Sometimes I play make belief and imagine myself as Static Shock and we&#8217;re a crazy dynamic duo.  Too bad Static Shock is DC and Jubilee is Marvel&#8230; I think of how awesome they would be together and just sigh&#8230; snap.&#8221;  Jen says &#8220;at first, I thought this was all a joke, but I think Andrew may have some much deeper issues we&#8217;re going to have to deal with.  I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about this whole Jubilation thing yet.  I mean, she can shoot little sparks out of her hands, how am I supposed to compete with that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Childhood classmate, Viraj, recalls &#8220;Andrew always used to bring <i>Uncanny X-Men #244</i> to class and read it when we were supposed to read <i>The Berenstain Bears</i>.  Honestly, I was a little jealous until I realized how consumed he was when he kicked a Chinese girl, Nancy, in the face when she said that Jubilee didn&#8217;t even look Asian.&#8221;  The incident Viraj recalls resulted in Nancy falling into a metal pole and damaging the back of her skull.  When asked about the attack, she recalls, &#8220;every time I feel the dent in the back of my head, I think of how obsessed Andrew is over Jubilee.  I mean like, jeez, I was just saying she didn&#8217;t look Chinese, how was I supposed to know?&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the personal issues this attraction may result in for Andrew, Jubilee is most definitely AndrewApproved.</p>
