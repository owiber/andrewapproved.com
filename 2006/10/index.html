<p>Okay, so I lied about Hawkgirl being the last comic character.  I think Booster Gold might be it, but I&#8217;m sure there will be surprises ahead when we find out more AndrewApproved characters from comicdom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to wear yellow sometimes to pretend I was Booster,&#8221; recalls Andrew.  &#8220;Once, I turned to Jen and called her Skeets&#8230; she was not amused.&#8221;  When asked about Andrew&#8217;s obsessions, Jen tells us of a particularly memorable situation.  &#8220;Once, he got confused and put on these angel wings like the kind you see Victoria Secret models wear, <i>and</i> he put on Booster Gold yellow and was some kind of crazy spawn child of Booster and Hawkgirl.  It was quite disturbing.  He ran around trying to give Keith a kiss while calling him &#8216;GL&#8217; and kept on yelling at this yellow cereal bowl we had&#8230; I think he was singing lyrics to Get Low by Lil&#8217; Jon &#038; the Eastside Boyz or something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Booster Gold is considered to be dead in current D.C. continuum.  &#8220;I sat in a corner of my room for days with the Skeets bowl on my head,&#8221; Andrew sobs.</p>

In our final installment of AndrewApproved comic book characters, we bring you Hawkgirl! &#8220;She&#8217;s my favorite in the Justice League,&#8221; remarks Andrew. &#8220;I wish I could go to sleep at night with Hawkgirl hugging me with her wings.  They&#8217;re beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Hawkgirl was kicked out of the Justice League in an animated series episode, Andrew was devastated. &#8220;I thought she was going to be gone forever.&#8221;  In a later season, she returned.  &#8220;When she came back in the next season, she wasn&#8217;t wearing her mask and I thought she was absolutely spectacular!&#8221; giggled Andrew.  &#8220;I think they underplayed Hotgi&#8230; <i>Hawk</i>girl&#8217;s powers in the cartoon because she&#8217;s obviously much more powerful than the rest of the Justice League,&#8221; he comments.</p>
<p>Andrew has been seen drawing pictures of Hawkgirl on his notes with a heart around her.  Though we have been unable thus far to obtain a photo of this, we have an artist&#8217;s rendition of it based on eye-witness accounts:</p>

<p>Andrew loves the new Batman cartoon by the WB.  &#8220;It is leaps and bounds better than the old Batman/Superman Adventures cartoon,&#8221; he raves.  &#8220;I love his new chiseled jaw!  And look at those kneecaps, oh those awesome kneecaps&#8230;&#8221; Andrew comments as he slowly curls into a ball and his eyes recede upwards as he lets out a slow moan&#8230;</p>
<p>Andrew gets up every day excited because he is one day closer to another The Batman episode.  &#8220;Sometimes, I only have to wait a few more hours!&#8221; he gasps.  &#8220;One day, this new Batman might replace Jubilee as my favorite character&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The Batman is in its fourth season on the WB.</p>

&#8220;I remember my friend Grace wanted to see Mona Lisa Smile instead of X2, and I thought she was insane&#8230; until I saw it myself,&#8221; recalls Andrew.  &#8220;Mona Lisa Smile is now one of my most favorite movies. *giggle* I&#8217;ve since learned to love other movies too.  I sold the DVDs I used to love like X2, Rocky, and Saving Private Ryan and have replaced them with multiple copies of Mona Lisa Smile (in case one of them got scratched), and I recently purchased The Lake House.  Keanu and Sandra are just so dreamy together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reports indicate that Andrew has watched Mona Lisa Smile at least two hundred times since its release.  When asked why Andrew loves MLS so much, he responded &#8220;in a world that tells me how to think, she showed me how to live.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mona Lisa Smile is available for $12.99 on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a>.</p>

Sources have confirmed a rumor claiming that Andrew has had a long time crush on the X-Men character, Jubilee (aka Jubilation Lee).  &#8220;I&#8217;ve never really had Asian fever, but I think Jubilee&#8217;s really hot,&#8221; comments Andrew.  &#8220;I see sparks even when she&#8217;s not using her mutant powers.&#8221;</p>
<p>When asked how this attraction effects his personal life, Andrew answered &#8220;well, one of the main reasons why I&#8217;m dating my current girlfriend is that both of their names start with a J.  Sometimes I pretend that Jen can shoot sparks out of her hands and it&#8217;s really cool.  Sometimes I play make belief and imagine myself as Static Shock and we&#8217;re a crazy dynamic duo.  Too bad Static Shock is DC and Jubilee is Marvel&#8230; I think of how awesome they would be together and just sigh&#8230; snap.&#8221;  Jen says &#8220;at first, I thought this was all a joke, but I think Andrew may have some much deeper issues we&#8217;re going to have to deal with.  I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about this whole Jubilation thing yet.  I mean, she can shoot little sparks out of her hands, how am I supposed to compete with that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Childhood classmate, Viraj, recalls &#8220;Andrew always used to bring <i>Uncanny X-Men #244</i> to class and read it when we were supposed to read <i>The Berenstain Bears</i>.  Honestly, I was a little jealous until I realized how consumed he was when he kicked a Chinese girl, Nancy, in the face when she said that Jubilee didn&#8217;t even look Asian.&#8221;  The incident Viraj recalls resulted in Nancy falling into a metal pole and damaging the back of her skull.  When asked about the attack, she recalls, &#8220;every time I feel the dent in the back of my head, I think of how obsessed Andrew is over Jubilee.  I mean like, jeez, I was just saying she didn&#8217;t look Chinese, how was I supposed to know?&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the personal issues this attraction may result in for Andrew, Jubilee is most definitely AndrewApproved.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, as evident by the above screenshot, Andrew used to hate Java.  However, we&#8217;ve discovered that he has since done a full 180 on this particular programming language and it is now his favorite.  &#8220;I remember when people used to call me Java Joseph and I used to hate it.  Now, it makes me all warm and fuzzy inside.  I love not having pointers and having garbage collection and I bet Java&#8217;s faster than C/C++!&#8221; comments a very excited Andrew.</p>
<p>Andrew has gone on record saying &#8220;I used to hate programming in Java, but then I realized that I was just fooling myself and I actually loved it.  I went back to school and took CS307 and CS315 four times over and over again because I just couldn&#8217;t get enough of those binary trees in Java.  I see null pointer exceptions and now I nearly wet my pants in excitement because I get to debug Java code!&#8221;</p>
<p>A Sun employee remarked &#8220;Andrew Joseph is an example for us all.  We are currently in talks with Andrew about being our Java mascot for our next PR compaign.  It&#8217;s pretty exciting working with such a high profile born-again Java coder.&#8221;  Sun&#8217;s new campaign is expected to launch in the first quarter of 2007.</p>
<p>For Christmas this year, Andrew plans on getting his four children Java Virtual Machines rather than the requested Micro Machines.  &#8220;If they don&#8217;t like it now, they&#8217;ll learn to love it like I did&#8221; says Andrew.</p>
<p>Java can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun Microsystems</a>.</p>

Today we have discovered that the Apple iPod is AndrewApproved! Andrew was seen purchasing approximately twenty iPods of various colors according to sources. An eye-witness reports &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen a grin as large as Andrew&#8217;s when he swiped his credit card and walked out that store.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another bystander recalls &#8220;the poor fellow attempted to listen to all of them at once, but his ears couldn&#8217;t fit all the headphones simultaneously.&#8221;  Fortunately, Andrew was not harmed as he tried to force all the headphones into his ears.</p>
<p>Andrew was seen driving off in his Mini Cooper (which he believes to be far superior to a Corvette) with the windows down yelling &#8220;OMG OMG OMG I <3 APPLE!!!!!!  THANK YOU, UNCLE STEVIEEEEEEEEEEE!!!&#8221;</p>
