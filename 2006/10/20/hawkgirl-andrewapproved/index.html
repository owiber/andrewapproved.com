In our final installment of AndrewApproved comic book characters, we bring you Hawkgirl! &#8220;She&#8217;s my favorite in the Justice League,&#8221; remarks Andrew. &#8220;I wish I could go to sleep at night with Hawkgirl hugging me with her wings.  They&#8217;re beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Hawkgirl was kicked out of the Justice League in an animated series episode, Andrew was devastated. &#8220;I thought she was going to be gone forever.&#8221;  In a later season, she returned.  &#8220;When she came back in the next season, she wasn&#8217;t wearing her mask and I thought she was absolutely spectacular!&#8221; giggled Andrew.  &#8220;I think they underplayed Hotgi&#8230; <i>Hawk</i>girl&#8217;s powers in the cartoon because she&#8217;s obviously much more powerful than the rest of the Justice League,&#8221; he comments.</p>
<p>Andrew has been seen drawing pictures of Hawkgirl on his notes with a heart around her.  Though we have been unable thus far to obtain a photo of this, we have an artist&#8217;s rendition of it based on eye-witness accounts:</p>
