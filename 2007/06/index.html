	<p>We&#8217;ve been gone for a while, but we return now to deliver you news on some of Andrew&#8217;s favorite things to eat.  First on the list is well done steak.  &#8220;I love pink, but I can&#8217;t stand any in the meat I eat,&#8221; explains Andrew.  &#8220;I like my steak well done, Julie style.  Burnt all over and the color of my skin inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>He goes on further to say &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how anyone can eat anything less than well done.  Cow vampires, all of them, I say.  I&#8217;d take a stake and shove it into their hearts, if I could.  Someday, I will become ruler of the world and destroy any chef that cooks meat less than well done&#8230; especially medium rare.  *shudder*&#8221;</p>
<p>The following is <b>WRONG</b>:<br />
<img id="image21" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2007/06/steak1.gif" alt="steak1.gif" /> <small>*picture from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juan23/166966133/">juan23</a></small></p>
<p>We asked Andrew his recommended method of cooking steak and he was kind enough to give us two ways!  &#8220;My first method is easy, but quite delicious.  Take the chunk of meat and put it on a microwave safe dish.  Stick that sucker into the microwave for about 50 minutes, then tada!!!  Awesome&#8230; I&#8217;m gonna start one right now. brb ^_^&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, the second method is to get a charcoal grill going and stick your pound of meat on it.  Walk away for a while and watch your favorite episode of Dharma &#038; Greg, then come back and check on it.  At this point, at least one side should have a very nice blackened texture to it.  Flip it.  Go watch your second favorite episode of Dharma &#038; Greg, come back and remove the meat.  Both sides should be quite black (perfect!).  Let it sit on your dinner table for about two hours, enough time to watch a whole DVD of Dharma &#038; Greg, then enjoy!&#8221;</p>
<p>We would like to thank Andrew very much for his kind cooking lessons.  Until next time!</p>
