			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.andrewapproved.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/andrew-loves-apple.jpg"><img src="http://www.andrewapproved.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/andrew-loves-apple.jpg" alt="" title="andrew-loves-apple" width="640" height="427" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38" /></a></p>
<p>Wow!  It&#8217;s certainly been a while!  With this new breath of life into the chronicling of all that is loved by Andrew Joseph, I thought I would give a homage to the <a href="http://www.andrewapproved.com/2006/10/16/apple-ipod-andrewapproved/">first Andrew Approved post</a>.  This time, I shall expand and note that Andrew not only loves the iPod, but basically everything that is Apple.</p>
<p>When I recently asked Andrew what he would want if his birthday were tomorrow, he replied &#8220;I would really really wuv wuv wuv an Apple iPad and I would hugs it forevs and forevs.&#8221;  I was a little confused.  &#8220;Andrew, don&#8217;t you already have like four of those?&#8221; I asked.  He looked at me as if I had killed his dog and said &#8220;but I need one for each of my limbs and one for my bosom!&#8221;  Whatever, Andrew.</p>
<p>A week ago, I came home to find Andrew messing around with something by my TV.  I didn&#8217;t get a chance to get a good look, but I could have sworn I saw him licking my Mac Mini moaning to himself &#8220;mmmmmmmmmmmiiiinnniiiiiii.&#8221;  Look, Andrew, I guess I&#8217;m fine with you licking my Mac Mini if it makes you happy, but make sure you wipe off your saliva afterwards, ok?</p>
<p>To top all of that off, the other day I was looking for my Magic Mouse, but I couldn&#8217;t find it.  I figured someone swiped it, but it&#8217;s kind of a terrible mouse so I didn&#8217;t really care that much.  Andrew was sleeping on the couch (at least I think he was) in the fetal position, but when he got up to leave, I heard a little clang and saw the Magic Mouse slip out of his right pants leg onto the floor.  &#8220;Uhhhh, Andrew&#8230;&#8221; I started, but then he just made a goofy smile, winked, and walked away.  I shook my head as I thought &#8220;I guess I don&#8217;t really want to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jen, Andrew&#8217;s girlfriend, recently moved to Texas and when I asked her how things were going she said &#8220;great, but sometimes Andrew worries me.&#8221;  I was like &#8220;oh?  how so?&#8221;  &#8220;Well,&#8221; she responded, &#8220;sometimes I want to give him a hug or lay on the couch next to him, but he pushes me away yelling at me about being careful around his iPhones and iPod Touches.&#8221;  Apparently Andrew has a pair of each and keeps them in all of his pants pockets.  When I confronted Andrew with this later, he gave me a stern &#8220;look, she can hug me all she wants later, but when my pants are full of Apple, it&#8217;s Stevie time, if you know what I mean.&#8221;  Uh&#8230; </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href='http://www.andrewapproved.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/a4797359-1ecf-45c6-9d32-4147dfd64439.jpg'><img src="http://www.andrewapproved.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/a4797359-1ecf-45c6-9d32-4147dfd64439.jpg" alt="" title="Texas Texas Tech Football" width="500" height="417" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31" /></a></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve just heard from eye witness accounts that the Texas Tech Red Raiders are AndrewApproved.  &#8220;Red&#8217;s my favorite color,&#8221; says Andrew.  &#8220;That&#8217;s why I was going for the Raiders in <a href="http://sports-ak.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=283062641">tonight&#8217;s game</a>.  They&#8217;ve got Texas in their name too, so same difference, right?  It&#8217;s win-win, so I just pick the color I like the best.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our sources then go on to say that if UT&#8217;s colors were pink and burnt orange, Andrew very likely would have switched sides. &#8220;I don&#8217;t really like orange that much but I do love red because it&#8217;s the color of love and red roses.  I like to skip through fields and pick pretty flowers to smell and roses are some of my bestest favorites.  I WUV WUV WUV THEM SO MUCH.&#8221;  Following that, there are allegedly recordings of Andrew clarifying his statements. &#8220;However, one color that definitely beats red in my book is pink because that&#8217;s the color of Barbie&#8217;s corvette and she&#8217;s so sexy, I wish I could be like her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andrew and I were watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0403508/">The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants</a> and every time a song would come on Andrew would gush &#8220;OMG, I absolute LOVE this song.&#8221;  He would even rewind just to listen to songs again.  At one point I was like &#8220;okay, Andrew, you&#8217;re ruining the movie&#8221; but he would just say something silly like &#8220;oh, I&#8217;m sorry, I thought it was a Hillary Duff song.&#8221;  I&#8217;m just glad he didn&#8217;t say anything about his loins again.</p>
<p>Once the movie was done, Andrew skipped to his room singing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt6PVVr4B04">So Yesterday</a>.  The happiness soon faded, however, when Andrew discovered that the movie had been erased from the DVR and he couldn&#8217;t listen to the soundtrack anymore.  Everyone, do him a favor and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sisterhood-Traveling-Pants-Original-Soundtrack/dp/B0009A3ZYY/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&#038;s=music&#038;qid=1220691080&#038;sr=8-13">order him a copy</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As many of you know, I have recently moved in with Andrew and a group of guys comes over every week to play World of Warcraft at our place.  Ever since Andrew was but a wee little fire mage years ago, he&#8217;s <em>loved</em> the sound gorillas make in WoW, and this love has since resurfaced&#8230;</p>
<p><a href='http://www.andrewapproved.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/gorilla.png'><img src="http://www.andrewapproved.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/gorilla.png" alt="Gorilla!" title="Gorilla!" width="325" height="415" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-27" border="0"/></a></p>
<p>We were playing WoW the other day and Andrew was all like &#8220;guys, I need to go to STV to get me some gorilla lovin&#8217;&#8221; and we were all like &#8220;Andrew, that&#8217;s silly.&#8221;  He insisted, however, and took the flight, Sam style, from Undercity to Booty Bay then headed to where the gorillas chilled.</p>
<p>A while later, we were all like &#8220;hey Andrew, you gonna help us out with this quest?&#8221; We got no reply.  I looked to my right and Andrew was slumped in his chair, eyes closes, and headphones on with a huge grin on his face.  I yanked off the headphones and this is what was playing:</p>
	<audio id="wp_mep_1" src="http://www.andrewapproved.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/gorillaaggroa2.mp3"     controls="controls" preload="none"  >
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		<object width="400" height="30" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="http://www.andrewapproved.com/wp-content/plugins/media-element-html5-video-and-audio-player/mediaelement/flashmediaelement.swf">
			<param name="movie" value="http://www.andrewapproved.com/wp-content/plugins/media-element-html5-video-and-audio-player/mediaelement/flashmediaelement.swf" />
			<param name="flashvars" value="controls=true&amp;file=http://www.andrewapproved.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/gorillaaggroa2.mp3" />			
		</object>		
	</audio>
<script type="text/javascript">
jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
	$('#wp_mep_1').mediaelementplayer({
		m:1
		
		,features: ['playpause','current','progress','duration','volume','tracks','fullscreen']
		,audioWidth:400,audioHeight:30
	});
});
</script>

<p>At this time, we had to intervene and we sat Andrew on the couch and had a good heart to heart.  We said &#8220;Andrew, this obsession you have with the gorilla sounds is both disturbing and unhealthy.&#8221;  Andrew protested &#8220;but it soothes me deep within my loins!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>I told Andrew I&#8217;m moving out&#8230;</p>

<p>Look at that plate of greens!  After devouring his salad, Andrew announced &#8220;that was so delicious!  Meat is nothing compared to all this precious chlorophyll!!!&#8221;  It is rumored that after testing the waters at Freescale Semiconductor, Andrew may quit to pursue his full time hobby of developing the &#8220;bestest salad with no meat EVAH!&#8221;</p>
<p>When questioned about his new obsession, Jen became very solemn and quietly said that &#8220;he likes to cuddle up in bed with bags of cauliflowers and asparagus instead of me.&#8221;  &#8220;Once, I saw him cradle a small tomato in his hands whispering sweet nothings to it&#8230;&#8221; </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve been gone for a while, but we return now to deliver you news on some of Andrew&#8217;s favorite things to eat.  First on the list is well done steak.  &#8220;I love pink, but I can&#8217;t stand any in the meat I eat,&#8221; explains Andrew.  &#8220;I like my steak well done, Julie style.  Burnt all over and the color of my skin inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>He goes on further to say &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how anyone can eat anything less than well done.  Cow vampires, all of them, I say.  I&#8217;d take a stake and shove it into their hearts, if I could.  Someday, I will become ruler of the world and destroy any chef that cooks meat less than well done&#8230; especially medium rare.  *shudder*&#8221;</p>
<p>The following is <b>WRONG</b>:<br />
<img id="image21" src="http://www.andrewapproved.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/steak1.gif" alt="steak1.gif" /> <small>*picture from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juan23/166966133/">juan23</a></small></p>
<p>We asked Andrew his recommended method of cooking steak and he was kind enough to give us two ways!  &#8220;My first method is easy, but quite delicious.  Take the chunk of meat and put it on a microwave safe dish.  Stick that sucker into the microwave for about 50 minutes, then tada!!!  Awesome&#8230; I&#8217;m gonna start one right now. brb ^_^&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, the second method is to get a charcoal grill going and stick your pound of meat on it.  Walk away for a while and watch your favorite episode of Dharma &#038; Greg, then come back and check on it.  At this point, at least one side should have a very nice blackened texture to it.  Flip it.  Go watch your second favorite episode of Dharma &#038; Greg, come back and remove the meat.  Both sides should be quite black (perfect!).  Let it sit on your dinner table for about two hours, enough time to watch a whole DVD of Dharma &#038; Greg, then enjoy!&#8221;</p>
<p>We would like to thank Andrew very much for his kind cooking lessons.  Until next time!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, I bring you a special AndrewApproved.com battle!  We&#8217;re going to go over the Mini Cooper and the Corvette and see how they compare and which one ends up on the top of the AndrewApproved list.  We&#8217;ll be going over a few categories used to qualify something as AndrewApproved and discuss which car wins out in each category then award AndrewApproved status to the one which wins the most! Wheeee!</p>
<p><b>In Pink</b><br />
We will see how the Cooper and the Corvette compare clad in pink, Andrew&#8217;s favorite color.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stoopidgirl/85439700/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/36/85439700_8d951c4268.jpg" alt="pink mini cooper" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thrayoona/176486210/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/54/176486210_a48b917b1c.jpg?v=0" alt="pink corvette"></a></p>
<p>Winner: Mini Cooper &#8211; &#8220;I love pink in every way possible, especially when Oliver wears it, but I think the Mini Cooper tickles my fancy more in pink because it&#8217;s just so cuuuuute!&#8221; &#8211; Andrew</p>
<p><b>Cuteness</b><br />
Andrew loves things that are cute.  And whatever car he drives must surge with cuteness.  The Mini is small and round-ish, very cute.  The corvette is like a razor, sharp and fast looking.  Not cute.</p>
<p>Winner: Mini Cooper &#8211; &#8220;I know the Corvette is fast and all, but who needs speed, when you can be cute!!!&#8221; &#8211; Andrew</p>
<p><b>Grace Vote</b><br />
Andrew highly values the opinions of his good friend, Grace, and she says that everyone would pick a Mini Cooper over a Corvette. </p>
<p>Winner: Mini Cooper &#8211; &#8220;Even if I were tempted to get a Corvette, I would remember the wise words of Grace and snap myself back into reality, where, obviously, everyone would pick a Cooper over the Corvette.  Duh, people. Duh.&#8221; &#8211; Andrew</p>
<p><b>In the Movies</b><br />
&#8220;I never remember any movies that feature Corvettes,&#8221; tells Andrew.  &#8220;But I really remember <i>The Italian Job</i> where they did super cool things with their Mini Coopers.  I bet if Charlie&#8217;s Angels got a hold of a few, they&#8217;d be unstoppable.  I <3 Drew Barrymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>Winner: Mini Cooper</p>
<p>Looks like the Mini Cooper wins with a solid four out of four!  &#8220;Yay!!! When I get my first paycheck, I&#8217;m getting a Mini Cooper!!!!&#8221; &#8211; Andrew</p>

<p>Okay, so I lied about Hawkgirl being the last comic character.  I think Booster Gold might be it, but I&#8217;m sure there will be surprises ahead when we find out more AndrewApproved characters from comicdom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to wear yellow sometimes to pretend I was Booster,&#8221; recalls Andrew.  &#8220;Once, I turned to Jen and called her Skeets&#8230; she was not amused.&#8221;  When asked about Andrew&#8217;s obsessions, Jen tells us of a particularly memorable situation.  &#8220;Once, he got confused and put on these angel wings like the kind you see Victoria Secret models wear, <i>and</i> he put on Booster Gold yellow and was some kind of crazy spawn child of Booster and Hawkgirl.  It was quite disturbing.  He ran around trying to give Keith a kiss while calling him &#8216;GL&#8217; and kept on yelling at this yellow cereal bowl we had&#8230; I think he was singing lyrics to Get Low by Lil&#8217; Jon &#038; the Eastside Boyz or something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Booster Gold is considered to be dead in current D.C. continuum.  &#8220;I sat in a corner of my room for days with the Skeets bowl on my head,&#8221; Andrew sobs.</p>

In our final installment of AndrewApproved comic book characters, we bring you Hawkgirl! &#8220;She&#8217;s my favorite in the Justice League,&#8221; remarks Andrew. &#8220;I wish I could go to sleep at night with Hawkgirl hugging me with her wings.  They&#8217;re beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Hawkgirl was kicked out of the Justice League in an animated series episode, Andrew was devastated. &#8220;I thought she was going to be gone forever.&#8221;  In a later season, she returned.  &#8220;When she came back in the next season, she wasn&#8217;t wearing her mask and I thought she was absolutely spectacular!&#8221; giggled Andrew.  &#8220;I think they underplayed Hotgi&#8230; <i>Hawk</i>girl&#8217;s powers in the cartoon because she&#8217;s obviously much more powerful than the rest of the Justice League,&#8221; he comments.</p>
<p>Andrew has been seen drawing pictures of Hawkgirl on his notes with a heart around her.  Though we have been unable thus far to obtain a photo of this, we have an artist&#8217;s rendition of it based on eye-witness accounts:</p>

<p>Andrew loves the new Batman cartoon by the WB.  &#8220;It is leaps and bounds better than the old Batman/Superman Adventures cartoon,&#8221; he raves.  &#8220;I love his new chiseled jaw!  And look at those kneecaps, oh those awesome kneecaps&#8230;&#8221; Andrew comments as he slowly curls into a ball and his eyes recede upwards as he lets out a slow moan&#8230;</p>
<p>Andrew gets up every day excited because he is one day closer to another The Batman episode.  &#8220;Sometimes, I only have to wait a few more hours!&#8221; he gasps.  &#8220;One day, this new Batman might replace Jubilee as my favorite character&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The Batman is in its fourth season on the WB.</p>
