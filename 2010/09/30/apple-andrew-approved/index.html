<p>Wow!  It&#8217;s certainly been a while!  With this new breath of life into the chronicling of all that is loved by Andrew Joseph, I thought I would give a homage to the <a href="../../../../2006/10/16/apple-ipod-andrewapproved/index.html">first Andrew Approved post</a>.  This time, I shall expand and note that Andrew not only loves the iPod, but basically everything that is Apple.</p>
<p>When I recently asked Andrew what he would want if his birthday were tomorrow, he replied &#8220;I would really really wuv wuv wuv an Apple iPad and I would hugs it forevs and forevs.&#8221;  I was a little confused.  &#8220;Andrew, don&#8217;t you already have like four of those?&#8221; I asked.  He looked at me as if I had killed his dog and said &#8220;but I need one for each of my limbs and one for my bosom!&#8221;  Whatever, Andrew.</p>
<p>A week ago, I came home to find Andrew messing around with something by my TV.  I didn&#8217;t get a chance to get a good look, but I could have sworn I saw him licking my Mac Mini moaning to himself &#8220;mmmmmmmmmmmiiiinnniiiiiii.&#8221;  Look, Andrew, I guess I&#8217;m fine with you licking my Mac Mini if it makes you happy, but make sure you wipe off your saliva afterwards, ok?</p>
<p>To top all of that off, the other day I was looking for my Magic Mouse, but I couldn&#8217;t find it.  I figured someone swiped it, but it&#8217;s kind of a terrible mouse so I didn&#8217;t really care that much.  Andrew was sleeping on the couch (at least I think he was) in the fetal position, but when he got up to leave, I heard a little clang and saw the Magic Mouse slip out of his right pants leg onto the floor.  &#8220;Uhhhh, Andrew&#8230;&#8221; I started, but then he just made a goofy smile, winked, and walked away.  I shook my head as I thought &#8220;I guess I don&#8217;t really want to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jen, Andrew&#8217;s girlfriend, recently moved to Texas and when I asked her how things were going she said &#8220;great, but sometimes Andrew worries me.&#8221;  I was like &#8220;oh?  how so?&#8221;  &#8220;Well,&#8221; she responded, &#8220;sometimes I want to give him a hug or lay on the couch next to him, but he pushes me away yelling at me about being careful around his iPhones and iPod Touches.&#8221;  Apparently Andrew has a pair of each and keeps them in all of his pants pockets.  When I confronted Andrew with this later, he gave me a stern &#8220;look, she can hug me all she wants later, but when my pants are full of Apple, it&#8217;s Stevie time, if you know what I mean.&#8221;  Uh&#8230; </p>

	<p>You update this site so infrequently that I don&#8217;t even have it on my rss reader.  Luckily I went to your website today.  </p>
<p>In any case, I think you hit the problem on the nose.  Most Apple fans only derive pleasure from Apple products.  It&#8217;s sad.  =(</p>
